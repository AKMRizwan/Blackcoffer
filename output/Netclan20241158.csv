Project Objective
"Project “Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies” objective was to Predict the Sentiments columns Shareholder Letter in terms of Polarity and Subjectivity finally classification of data into positive, negative and neutral tone."
Project Description
"The project ‘Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of US Companies’ task involved data cleaning on shareholder letters of different companies which includes lemmatization, lower case conversion, removing special character, \n , \t , punctuations, numbers & single character and tokenization. To generate polarity and subjectivity columns for the letter 1 & letter 2 columns using the Textblob library of NLTK. Based on the polarity categorizing it into positive, neutral  &  negative."
Our Solution
Letter Text Length Variation
Contraction mapping on dataset
Replacing missing value with some neutral tone string like None so that cleaning doesn’t generate any issue.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing which involves :
i.  Lemmatisation
ii. lower case conversion
iii.  Removing Special character
"iv.  Removing \n , \t etc"
"v.  remove punctuations, numbers & single character removal"
vi.  forming list of letter data using tqdm
Tokenization and word count.
Used Textblob Library which is part of NLTK for Sentiment analysis.
Created Polarity and Subjectivity column for the Letter1 & Letter2 columns
"Based on the polarity of letter 1 created a letter1_type column with values “positive” , “neutral”  &  “negative” category."

Models used
"My project ‘Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective."
● Software Model : Waterfall Model
"● For Project ‘Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of US Companies’ is a Waterfall Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start using Textblob which predicts Sentiments, Polarity and Subjectivity as the output following the Waterfall Model."

Figure 5: Sentiments assignment based on polarity
"figure 5 represents the identification of sentiments and tone based on polarity and subjectivity. polarity>0 then sentiment type is positive,  if the polarity<0 sentiment type is negative and if the polarity=0 sentiment type is neutral."
