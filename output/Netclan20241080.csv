Client Background
Client: A leading retail firm in Newzealand
Industry Type:  Retail
Services: Retail business
Organization Size: 100+
The Problem
Companies face issue of having a Single customer under various rows with slightly different information in the same database. This causes unwanted duplication and inaccurate statistics. It also results in inaccurate ad targeting and financial loss.
Our Solution
We leverage graph technology to create a single customer view by using Complex cypher queries  and Graph Algorithms.
Solution Architecture
We have an Azure VM on which we have installed the Neo4j Database. Deployment architecture is a single Instance because of using the Community version of the software.
