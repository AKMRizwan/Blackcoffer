"Use of open-source LLM models like Llama, with training on custom data."
Implementation of Q&A from custom static data.
SaaS deployment to serve multiple hospitals/practices.
Demonstration of sample chats using the custom-trained model early in the project.
"Deployment on optimized servers (preferably CPU-based for execution, GPU-based acceptable for training)."
"Periodic testing, transition, and demos before payment release."
Provision of APIs for communication with databases to fetch dynamic data.
Model Training: Train the Llama model with custom data specific to eye care patient queries.
"API Development: Develop APIs to communicate with the hospital’s database for dynamic data retrieval (appointment booking, order status, patient dues)."
"Deployment: Deploy the chatbot as a SaaS solution using optimized servers (CPU for execution, GPU for training)."
Testing and Demo: Conduct periodic testing and demos to ensure functionality and transition smoothly.
Sample Chat Demonstration: Provide sample chats to demonstrate the effectiveness of the custom-trained model.
"Llama or another suitable open-source LLM model, trained with custom data only."
"Python (preferred), with a possibility of using C# for backend implementation if feasible."
"Optimized CPU-based servers for execution, with GPU-based servers for initial model training."
Custom-developed APIs for database interaction.
