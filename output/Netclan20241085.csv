Project Description
"Our client, Arik Oganesian, approached us with a requirement to create a dashboard for his friend’s e-commerce website, Symbiome. The dashboard needed to be visually appealing and provide comprehensive insights into the website’s performance. We sourced data from various sources such as Bigquery Database, Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Facebook Ads. To create the dashboard, we used Google Data Studio and Google Sheets to link the data sources. We also used SQL language to extract data from Bigquery Database. The client specifically asked for cohort retention and cohort revenue charts to be included in the dashboard. With our expertise in data analytics, we were able to fulfill the client’s requirements and provide a dashboard that helped the client make data-driven decisions."
