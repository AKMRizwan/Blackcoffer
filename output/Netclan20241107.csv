Client Background
Client: A Design & Media firm in the USA
Industry Type: Marketing
"Services: Consulting, Software, Marketing Solutions"
Organization Size: 100+
Project Objective
Create a python web application that detects the text and checks the spelling of written text in the videos and prints the count of wrong spelling in the end
Project Description
Developing a dockerized Django web application for detecting the text and checking the spelling of written text in the video and printing the count of wrong spelling in the end and deploying the application on google cloud
Our Solution
We have created a python web application with Django framework when user uploads the video the application run keras-ocr model on each frame of the video and keep the count of the wrong words at the end it provides the video with the bounding box around the words. For correct words it creates green bounding box and for wrong words it creates red bounding box and also it provides the summation of count of wrong words.
Project Deliverables
Deployed dockerized web application on google cloud which generate video with bounding box around texts

What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
Running model on each frame of the video
Show progress bar for the progress of the work
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
For running the model on each frame of the video we have used celery it runs the model in the backend of the application
We have used celery backend progressrecorder and updated it every time when model has detected the text from the frame of the video
