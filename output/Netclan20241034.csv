The Problem
This project aims to classify people and different organizations into two categories using BERT-based models for natural language processing.
Our Solution
Utilized pre-trained BERT-based models for text classification.
Fine-tuned the models on the sample dataset of the provided dataset for optimal performance.
Implemented an evaluation metric to assess the model’s accuracy.
Giving the Classification report and accuracy.

What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
The problem was the higher GPU limit is required to process the big dataset.
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
"We shifted our notebook from Google Colab to Kaggle Notebook as it offers more GPU usage limits. Also, we took sample data from a given big dataset and processed it quickly."
Business Impact
"The project successfully implemented a text classification solution using BERT-based models. The model achieved promising results in classifying people into organizational categories. The documentation outlines the steps from data loading to model training and evaluation, providing a comprehensive project overview."
