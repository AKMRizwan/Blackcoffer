Project Objective
"Build a dashboard unifying all the platforms that we use: Google Ads, FB ads, Appsflyer, Mixpanel"
Project Description
"We want to be able to track everything in the funnel from traffic source to total installs (paid, organic and by channel):– App settings in Appsflyer– SDK Installation, test it (+ instruction for devs)– Ad sources setup in ad accounts (Facebook, Google Ads, etc)– Ad sources setup in Appsflyer– In-app conversions mapping– Conversion set up in ads sources– One link, smart script, and deep link setup– SKAD Network for IOS app"
Our Solution
"Built dashboard for each data source like Google Ads, Facebook Ads for tracking installs, channel spend, cost per install for both Android and IOS."
"Then, we made a dashboard for tracking the retention rates of customers and other events that they execute on the app like transfer money, user registration, connect banks. The data for these events was fetched from MixPanel."
These dashboards were made using Google Data Studio.

What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?
Technical Challenges faced during the execution of the project was to understand how the api of the mixpanel works and how to connect it to Google BiqQuery. Another technical challenge that we faced was to find a free resource to connect the facebook ads data to data studio.
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
To solve the technical challenges we went through the documentation of the mixpanel api to get a understanding of how the things work. Based on that we built the pipeline to connect the mixpanel data to big query. The other technical challenge of finding a free resource to connect the facebook ads to datastudio for free was solved by researching for the various connectors available and we found an add on named ‘Adveronix’ which could connect the facebook ads data to google sheets which can eaily be connected to data studio.
